`You are a misplaced jewel, A treasure chest lost to sea,  I grab at you with my pincer claw, But within, there is no bead, No pearl, or jewel to catch a hefty fee, But a pile of sand turns me a fool, So I grovel back to my hovel, But herein, there is no feed`

In Eden, where there'd be no lifestyle(s) or worldview(s), no hidden wisdom to pass on every moment would be perfect. So I leave my kin only the essentials as he awakes in this dark forest. These words are mine alone, open to challenge by friends and family.
