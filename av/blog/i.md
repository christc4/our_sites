`You are a misplaced jewel, A treasure chest lost to sea,  I grab at you with my pincer claw, But within, there is no bead, No pearl, or jewel to catch a hefty fee, But a pile of sand turns me a fool, So I grovel back to my hovel, But herein, there is no feed`

## Summary

In Eden, where there'd be no lifestyle(s) or worldview(s), no hidden wisdom to pass on every moment would be perfect. So I leave my kin only the essentials as he awakes in this dark forest. These words are mine alone, open to challenge by friends and family.

##  <a name='agit-prop'>Agit Prop</a>

## Agitation Propaganda

For every solutionist worth their salt there are a dime-a-dozen if not more agitation person(s), they rile up their audiences leaving them in a frenzied state of agitation over inconsequential and often faraway events.

Georgi Plekhanov's distinction follows, _"A propagandist presents many ideas to one or a few people, an agitator on the other hand presents only one or a few ideas to a mass of people... Agitation is thus the use of political slogans and half-truths to exploit the grievances of the public and thereby to mold public opinion and mobilize public support"_

Vladimir Lenin explained in a 1902 pamphlet, _What Is to be Done_,  his beliefs on the role of the propagandist and agitator

- Propagandists would work with media
- Agitators, for their part, act on emotional levels, rousing people to take an interest in social ills

Agit-prop lives on from soviet-times, its spiritual descendents being the numerous political pundits littering your feed after any major politicism whose long-winded rants while sometimes dropping pithy remarks only tangentially touch on 'possible' solutions are just hard-coded signals to your anger receptors.

## Addendum

Just keep in mind the following

When you're agitated

- You're prone to be duped
- Be blindsided of who the ''real'' culprits string-pullers are
- Waste time and more importantly energy on not doing what in your heart of hearts is the solution

## <a name=amazon-society>Amazon Society</a>

Music stores, with listening booths, arts 'n crafts stores with  benches to paint. Doesn't amazon and online shopping have a hand in destroying those places of gathering

##  <a name='autism'>Autism</a>

Being on the 'verge, brink, edge' are scenarios you'd be hardpressed to find a low functioning  Autist in.

Autistic people, like every animal, are sensitive to stimuli, If they are exposed to too much stimuli they will try to exit the stressful environment or if  detained will thrash.

That is very normal.

Domesticated humans are 'adapted' in the sense that they can tolerate and aclimatize to stressful environments.

Lack of stimuli will also provoke an autistic person. They will exit a boring classroom.

It is viewed 'normal' for an autist to seek the path of least resistance because they are 'special' but if an ordinary person was to do the same they would face a lot of criticism.

Due to how society is structured, it is and cannot be Edenic, humans had to apopt non-autistic traits.

Autism is the default state of mankind. Autistic people are closer to bearing the same scent animals smelled upon Adam in the Garden.

##  <a name='blind-spot'>Blind spot</a>

It never occured to me in my naive adolesence that perhaps they were viewing the past with rose-tinted spectacles

_Do not say, "Why were the former days better than these?" For you do not inquire wisely concerning this_ Ecclesiastes 7:10

One should pay particular attention if a doddering oldie might airbrush over a segment of their lives

## Common frames of reference

Common frames of reference, whether pop-culture, literature, history, religion in a way are social interactions which instill a sense of bond between people.. The more localised and niche one can pick up on a reference the stronger the bond.

In Gulliver's Travels there exists a particular people called the [Struldbruggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struldbrugg), hailing from the nation of Luggnagg who are in fact immortal!

One adverse effect of such a _blessing_ was that the elderly and young could no longer communicate, their once common tongue had drifted apart enormously between generations.

Back to real life... I can relay this thought to being schooled in Shadwell, East London. The white English teachers would often give pithy remarks in Cockney speak or use Cockney to chide us. I of course, am not a Cockney but I had enough little grey cells to put 2 and 2 together. However, my Shadwell schooling ended in 2016 and as I am aware, people do die. And as the immigrant children of Shadwell grow up they will start applying for the same teaching jobs my Cockney teachers once held. So I do not expect new waves of schooled immigrant children to know a smattering of Cockney

In Roman Road, East London, there was an elderly English man manning a clothes shop once and I vividly spoke to him about 'starched collars'. I knew of their existence and prevalence because I for a time was fascinated with historical tailoring. He seemed much delighted that I understood what it meant to collect one's colours and give them to the laundromat for them to come out hard as a brick! He also was able to talk about the Teddy Boy phenomenom to which I also knew about

##  <a name='chinese-characters'>Chinese Characters</a>

TODO, add uncle hanzi stuff

CHINESE CHARACTERS WERE ONCE EXTREMELY LOGICAL... LONG AGO

Look at these symbols

<img src=pix/share.svg><img src=pix/contactless.svg><img src=pix/recycle.svg>

Imagine, you live in an uncontacted tribe and the concept of 'sharing a file' or 'contactless payment' is beyond your brain. Maybe, a smart member of the tribe, could see what these symbols represent, perhaps llikening the waves to a ripple in water, or the share dots as links, or the arrows as a continuation of something.

But for the most part, these symbols are more about memorisation than understanding.

<img src=pix/dumbbell.avif><img src=pix/dumbbell1.avif>

_redacted_ says,

`I don't see how it's unintuitive. The icon is an undirected graph where each node is a person, and each edge denotes a sharing action`

Maybe you can think conceptually like _redacted_

For me it looks like two vintage dumbbells

# City love

2024/10/21

## Can you actually ''love'' a city?

If  your soil becomes infertile and your rivers start to dry, your way of life goes belly-under.

Whereas in an urban environment, as long as you are geographically close to your work/school and economically 'safe' - you are more or less fine.

If your city is full of betting shops on every corner and societal ills creep into everyones way of life, as long as the above two criterion are met - again you are 'fine'.

Your stake in the city isn't tied down to the environment, ever see a most polluted cities list?

##  <a name='college'>College</a>

An interesting phenemonom studying English-Literature.

I asked all of my English Literature teachers, one had PhD, one studied at Oxford, other at Cambridge and teaches at the prestiguous Eton college, have they ever published book/poem or if I can read their writings that are not essays on other peoples work.

They all said no and one teacher said very coyly, she is a poet but it's personal and she would feel embarassed sharing.

That's interesting, a lot of poets or authors, they wanted their work to be burned by a friend upon their death, instead their friend marvelling about their work gets it published and so many years later we end up studying it under an academic lens..

<hr>

What I find even more fascinating, is that as my eyes crawled through some of the books we studied, it felt like a stream of consciousness of a deadman, is being injected into me, and so I started committing passing phrases, wordy english words to memory, writing them down. Instead of analysing it and breaking it down, I filled my spare pages, with beautiful paragraph openings and sentence types. I felt so compelled to write afterwards.

<hr>

Maybe this is why I got a B, after sitting the exam two-times

 everything said will be looked at under a microscope.

One of the easiest gages on someones subject knowledge is their fallacy count.

<img src=pix/copper.avif>

> _You got a licence for that fallacy?_

As said hundreds of times by J.Dyer...

Words can encompass a totality or a particular. Words are vehicles for concepts. Words can have one or many referrants.

This is a star example

## Other

Also lots of people had a go at Varg Vikernes for owning a computer, refrigerator etc. when it came to his philosophy a "simpler life" for being a total contradiction.

Note how Varg chose to phrase his way of life as "simpler" not "simple"

Yet dozens of people got hung up over basic grammar...

# Exercise draft

## Things better to do than 'exercise'

- Carry baby on your back and go on a hike
- Find cool rocks and bugs with siblings/kids

2024/10/21

If you are anti exercise most people are equipped with extreme tunnel vision and will immediately shut you down as a couch potato. More often than not, those people are simply 'using' exercise to get out of whatever rut they're in - they're not actually doing anything. There are countless peoples in the exercise annals who had to explain what exercise was, it was so unheard of to people

Treadmills torture device the guy who populrised running?

## Exercise is natural

A lot and a lot of people appeal to the fact humans are hunter-gatherers but what's lost on a lot of people is the type of hunting people used to do. Most hunting revolves around:

- lurking
- marksmanship
- tracking

occasionally you would run to your prey,

People also have backwards what is sedentary, walking long distances in a non-exertive fashion should be classed as sedentary, walking with your baby strapped to you many miles is also sedentary.


## Bodybuilding

Trying to get through to a body bulider is like trying to get through a brick wall

### Bodybuilding is ''natural''

Many erroneously equate bodybuilding to one of man's ''primal'' urges, such as rock-lifting... Why wwould a human exert, kill their cells, to lift rocks in nature? To attract other men. Most lifting in nature would be animal carcasses, and even then... Large game would be collectively carried by you and your kin.

There is nothing natural to wolf, scarf, shovel down large quantiities of your 'catch' to gain muscles.

col

es there aree life or death scenarios where being ablee to perform a firemans carry is essential,

Then theres people who call upon farmers strength,
in nature everone would be more or less lean, so you wouldnt need to any strenous ligtig

I have a history of being successful in long distance running and an amateur compilation of calisthenics movement, note how I didn't decide to leverage it to lend me 'credibility'

## The Modern-Web

In prehistoric times, evils  forces like centralization, censorship and moral degeneracy hadn't fully seeded itself in the web.  You could've treated the web like a library waiting for readers to come flocking in - the only invisible hand moving you towards different on theshelf was your own interest.

Having touched upon Adam Smith's 'invisible hand', let me propose some alternatives to giving your children free-rein where the algorithm could steer them...

This is a shell script [The Ultimate Way of Browsing Channels](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/pull/1320). As the author puts it

> _"No browsers, accounts, distractions, crappy algorithm and recommendations, advertisements, sponsors, intros, outros, fillers or empty spaces. We eliminate them all"_

## Centralised or Decentralised

<img src=pix/centralized-decentralized.avif>

Common people are more impressed if you design a platform as algorithmically and systematically as can be. They will believe more in it. The more it mimicks the society they live, the more invested they will be in it. If you can replicate the congregration of people in a town square - agglomerate it into smooth scrollable interface, you've created magic. 

This digitial town square, by nature, sounds very 'centralised' right?

But beyond the crowds of people, 'centralised' in this instance refers to 'central' authority responsible for safeguarding users, enforcing rules and the general maintenance of  the town center.

For us in today's world, a decentralized society would be total anarchy, chaos manifest.

What direct comparison can we draw to real life - what society has no government to pave the roads, patch up the potholes, feed the poor and care for the sick. Well just like how the web is magic, magic makes decentralisation easier.

But what happen's when you get kicked out of said town told to pack up your soapbox and take  to the road?

> For reference this is a soapbox, John Major former UK prime minister pictured atop one

<img src=pix/john_major_soapbox.avif>

The newly exiled may float in and out of other towns finding signs akin to the "No Irish, No Blacks, No Coloured' but pertaining to his particular strain of thought. Maybe he will band together with other exiles, and this exodus will start a new platform and we are back to the town square.

## Who else is in the town square?

Laxed laws and fear have gotten most of the townsfolk turning a blind eye and those in authority ready to bring out the most deranged of dungeonfolk out into sunlight. Same, with all platforms. 

If you see where I'm getting at, you're probably ready to write this article of as one that presents a zero-sum game and doesn't say anything new.

I have a solution and I'd like you to consider it.

## todo

Remember that invisible force I described earlier how about you see it as an invisible hand, the algorithm, systematicall designed to push down ones throat

## What is a site

Most sites are glorified chainlinks - their primary function being the showing of a video for example, with many additions packaged in. Such as a comment and recommended section.

Knowing that - why don't the exiles have their own platform 

YouTube would funtion exactly the same for ninety percent of its viewers, if all it was a search bar, that spat out exactly what you put in. 

In short, when you access their site, you want to get from point A to B, video you want to watch comes to mind, you land on site

# Offloading parenting

*Last update: 2024/09/20*

Offloading parenting is the transferral of father/motherly duties onto others. The closest word in modern exchange is  'outsourcing'

> _where you move internal operations to a third party_

At its core, imagine it as passing the parental torch onto total strangers.

To prime our brains let's disect the commonmost scenarios.

## Scenario A

*Note to reader*: I only draw upon 'fitness' since its a popular example. Real 'fit'ness is going on hikes with your kids and finding cool rocks or bugs.. Not running aimlessly or lifting man-made weights..

A dad never begins a fitness regimen with his son. Young and impressionable, he soon becomes totally enraptured by an influencer promising them an incredible return rate for simply starting fitness - all the while introducing moral decay to your childs world view - and thus their working out stems from such influences

Go ahead and rightfully label their wellspring of motivation as a:

- grifter
- con-artist
- snake-oil salesman
- pimp (not a Positively.Inspirational.Motivational.Person)

Your points no matter how true they ring become null and void. Your standing as a man of fitness is non-existant

## Scenario B

Every child has a natural affinity to games,

That doesn't mean a parent has to do his homework on every triple A title and grind hours in a battle royale. Knowing about board gamees, dice games, card games, indie games, story games, point and click, RTS doesn't hurt you. By forgoing this bonding experience with them, transfers this to an online community or YouTuber..

## What isn't offloading?

You'd be right to point out, not everyone is a physicist, would I be offloading my parental duties by hiring a Physics tutor to teach my child? Let's touch back on the definition of outsourcing,

> to move core operations to a third party

 Keep a breadth of wise, knowledgeable friends. Friends that are good at manual work and those that are more scientifically suited, then its okay to offload the hard stuff

With friends, you can vet them, with teachers and tutors not so much. Of course everyone has skeletons in their closet. But I like to think our friends are on our side. 

## Who is most guilty of  this

When I was younger, I loved seeing rural American families pass on hunting skills to their kids, I think urbanites are most guilty of this

### Solutions

People can be lazy, unwilling, neglecent. Morally compromised. People might also not know any better. In a parent's heart of hearts I like to believe they already know what they think of the term 'offloading'
# Philosophy

2024/10/05

## Art

The 'you must be this tall to ride' equivalent in the 'art-world' is whether or not you can draw a face, free-style or through precision tools, it doesn't matter. If I see you have mutilated a face, your opinion becomes null and void to me.

> "The eyes! The window to the soul! The face! The terminus between people!"

## On friends

[Dunbar's number](http://95.179.238.202/archive/think/dunbar_number) holds that we can only maintain 150 relationships.

The two lowest common denominators that act as friendships' glue is

> utility + satisfaction

### Burn a bridge or drain a swamp?

Can you salvage a friendship built on locker-room talk? Maybe, but it'll be the shortest-burning candle to ever candle.

See Yusuf, the bitter truth

<hr>

## Software

When you can no longer see the forest for the trees. When the artisans, hobbyists and tinkerers move out and the industrialists, contracters, men in suits step in, I generally step out

### Minimalism

If you are principled on what you believe. I respect you. If you are not and tout the latest slogan, you are 'faux' and to be ousted

Lot's of people maybe for tongue and cheek throw out 'ed is the original unix editor' and others spend their time bickering on 'vim Vs emacs'.

I care about operation count, first and foremost.

How many operations does it take to do this, then I compare which is more performant

#### Minimalism, a time vampire?

I weigh with the finest scale each addition to my code, 

### Wingnuts

True wingnuts who remain principled to the core, who wouldn't give CPR to their own father for fear of being called gay, they I can somewhat respect


I have even encountered freedom zealots who haven't the faintest clue what the IME is.. But will happily lecture me on why

### Web

Am I a mutilating surgeon of HTML?

Why so 'barebones'? Is my life just bleak. Why not snazz things up a bit?

##  <a name='on-classic-thinkpads'>On Classic ThinkPads</a>

Here are my qualifications for all you occultists and knowitalls

Fixed a ThinkPad R51 and installed Puppy Linux on it

Daily drove a X61 for a year

_Been_ daily driving a x220, later a x230 for 5 years ongoing

todo add photos

## Should you buy an old ThinkPad?

- Is your computer usage processor intensive?
	- Video rendering, compilation, Triple A gaming?
	- go away

- Do you only edit documents, read emails and watch YouTube?
	- Then probably

- Are you worried about your laptop being stolen?
	- If yes, and you answered no to the first question. Then probably.

- Do you know what you are doing?
	- Then buy.

- Do you know or care about coreboot/libreboot?
	- If no to both, don't buy.

But I can have two machines! I can have my main rig kitted out for all the heavy lifting! And I can have a ThinkPad be my rugged retainer!

Go away.

### Even shorter answer

Unless you are a tinker willing to part with his time, don't bother.
I'd recommend keeping your eyes peeled on devices like the Framework laptop

## Back to wordy blog&hellip;

ThinkPads&hellip; the classic fixer-upper that you'll shell hundreds of dollars into - to get it even comparable to a modern machine. Or is it?

Let's find out!

As someone whose primary work, for a year, was reparing and reselling ThinkPads - I sort of have a position. Mind you, I'm out of the loop when it comes to current market prices but I can give my 2 cents. As per the title, this is going to tackle the subject of _old_ ThinkPads, what qualifies as _old_ - I'll say anything pre x240 era.

Say you're in the market for a *used* ThinkPad, we're gonna need to establish a long list of things.

1. Are you willing to learn new things?
    - Are you the person who is grossed out by the nipple? Unwilling, to learn a lighter operating system like Linux or BSD? Expecting. Learn to repair and swap parts?
    - If you're in the camp that says _X is only cheap, if your time is valueless_ then ThinkPads are not for you.

2. Are you prepared to deal with issues sourcing batteries?
    - Genuine OEM batteries are rarer by the day, as soon as you see one listed - snag it asap - as long as the price is reasonable.

# Buying experience

If you aren't buying direct from an enthusiast, you'll most likely be temporarily lumbered with someone's clunky old machine - shelved for eternity - if you hadn't bid on it. ThinkPads can be cheap as chips depending how you go about this.

Keycaps may be mirror-y,

Thought experiment
If a thinkpad is replaced part by part is it still the same ThinkPad?

ThinkPad on its last legs?
So what happens eventually when software becomes too bloated you can't run it? Home server?

ThinkPads are good for what they are.

If you plan on staying with it, you'll see how good she can treat you

##  <a name='on-thrifting'>On Thrifting</a>

Some people thrift simply because its the more economic option.

Others, deluded by lofty ideas, think they are fighting the big man 'fast fashion' like how people try to stick it to 'big pharma'

The 'holy grails' of thrifting are from a bygone era which you have no connection to - that includes the boxiness of the 80s, funkiness of the 70s. 

Not to mention, the numerous individual anatomical quirks you possess...

Sloping shoulders, one shoulder longer than the other, armhole/scye length...

Thrifting is good at removing clothes out of circulation yes.

But what we really need to breathe life into is the new generation of artisans. 

Bespoke tailors who are capable of weaving together your imaginary threads of the perfect garb into something tangible - that's sculpted to your body.
