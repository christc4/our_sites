## Agitation Propaganda

For every solutionist worth their salt there are a dime-a-dozen if not more agitation person(s), they rile up their audiences leaving them in a frenzied state of agitation over inconsequential and often faraway events.

Georgi Plekhanov's distinction follows, _"A propagandist presents many ideas to one or a few people, an agitator on the other hand presents only one or a few ideas to a mass of people... Agitation is thus the use of political slogans and half-truths to exploit the grievances of the public and thereby to mold public opinion and mobilize public support"_

Vladimir Lenin explained in a 1902 pamphlet, _What Is to be Done_,  his beliefs on the role of the propagandist and agitator

- Propagandists would work with media
- Agitators, for their part, act on emotional levels, rousing people to take an interest in social ills

Agit-prop lives on from soviet-times, its spiritual descendents being the numerous political pundits littering your feed after any major politicism whose long-winded rants while sometimes dropping pithy remarks only tangentially touch on 'possible' solutions are just hard-coded signals to your anger receptors.

## Addendum

Just keep in mind the following

When you're agitated

- You're prone to be duped
- Be blindsided of who the ''real'' culprits string-pullers are
- Waste time and more importantly energy on not doing what in your heart of hearts is the solution
