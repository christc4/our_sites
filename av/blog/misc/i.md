## <a name=alcohol-remedy>Alcohol, remedy?</a>

Did parents do this historically?

I remember hearing this a while back so I decided to check

A cursory web search says this was indeed the case! The following are posts in a 2009 forum from! [welltrainedmind.com](https://forums.welltrainedmind.com/topic/133159-did-your-parents-or-grandparents-medicate-children-with-alcohol/), including my understanding of terms

A "hot toddy" is whiskey mixed with warm water and honey, administered to sickly kids

The below are responses,

<details><summary>Unfurl to see forum responses</summary>

<p style="text-align: left;">Whiskey, honey and lemon during a bout of whooping cough, but the whiskey was only a splash with everything else on a spoon,</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">

</p>


I think it had a lot to do with society's view of alcohol and children. So many older stories I've read (Wuthering Heights comes immediately to mind) include children with bits of alcohol as almost nonchalante. I'm fairly certain that if I would have told anyone at school mom or dad gave me a shot of whiskey to help me sleep, someone would have been knocking on thier door shortly thereafter.
my mom never bought any medicines when I was a child. My brother and I were either given a spoon of sugar covered in whiskey (gross) or a mustard plaster with onions pinned to our shirt at night (double gross). I have never been able to drink whiskey as to me, it means medicine lol.

<p style="text-align: left;">
Unless you count things like Robitussin, which was alcohol based when I was a kid. I generally give my kids tinctures when they have something I feel I need to treat, and I give them sublingually (under the tongue) so the herbs are absorbed more directly.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">remember being given hot toddies or the pujeen (sp?) when I was a child by my great aunt:) It did me no harm and I fondly remember it as a comfort when I was sick. think of Mrs. Slocombe on Are You Being Served?</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">We have always preferred alternative and old fashion remedies, but it was not until last winter that my husband began making himself a hot toddies before bed to rest when he had a really bad cold. I have got to say that he rested well and got over it quickly. I have had one have helped me a time or two since.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">
We have not given any to our daughter yet--she has not had such bad symptoms since then--but I think neither of us would be opposed to do so should she have really bad symptoms and unable to rest.</p>

 
<p style="text-align: left;">on another note, my mother was born blue at home and the doctor walked away saying she would not live the night. they were a poor family and this was in 1940. my grandfather gave her drops of sherry to warm her and rubbed/massaged her until she was warm, pink, and responsive. obviously, she lived.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">No, but four years ago I had a flight attendant comp me a bottle of whiskey while I was holding my crying 1 year old "in case I needed a little something for her gums."</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
My dad who was very against alcohol began drinking 'hot toddy's' when he was in the last stages of colon cancer. It seemed to make things a little more bearable for him.</p>


<p style="text-align: right;">
I had a horrible cough, and she knew a man who made moonshine. So she sent my daddy to see the man and buy the moonshine, and then she gave it to me. I don't know what she mixed with it, though. I don't remember the incident at all, but the story has become part of our family's lore.</p>

 
<p style="text-align: left;">
I remember Granny giving me paregoric (camphorated tincture of opium) too, on more than one occasion when I was sick as a young child. At the time (1960s), paregoric could be bought over the counter. I remember that it tasted kind of like licorice, which I did not like.
<p style="text-align: right;">

 

<p style="text-align: right;">
Several years later, when I was a young teen, I remember Granny giving me a big serving spoon full of whiskey mixed with sugar when I had menstrual cramps.</p>

p. my grandparents did. Good Irish catholics. My dad always only just threatened us with a stiff shot of whiskey when we were sick. He was much too fond of the stuff to use it as medicine for children!

Posted October 13, 2009
When my son was born, my MIL told me that she used to mix a shot of vodka with the formula in DH's baby bottle "so he would sleep through the night and [FIL] wouldn't have to get up and feed him." Like she was doing my FIL a favor! :blink:

Jackie
 I was sick and couldn't stop coughing, my parents would give me a teaspoon of whiskey (usually Wild Turkey) with a marshmallow "chaser".
Nasty stuff but it worked.
remember my mom having Paragoric by prescription and we would get a dose of that for almost anything. I am pretty sure our pediatrician prescribed this. I can still recall that it tasted like straight scotch! (Not that I knew that at the time!) It was also an added ingredient in a diarrhea medicine that we used to have to take from time to time. I remember asking a pharmacist where I could get some once after I had my own children, and was told it was a narcotic! Wow, was I surprised! This may explain a lot about my siblings and me :lol:/
my mother made us drink cooking sherry when we were sick. I cannot stand drinking alcohol to this day, it just reminds me of vomiting.

oth my parents and grandparents did this and I am also one of the parents old enough to have done this as well. I have recently had this unofficially recommended to me by licensed medical personnel. Alcohol or narcotics are effective cough medicines because they act on the cough center of the brain and dull the cough reflex. They are more effective than over the counter cough medicines that do not contain alcohol. As a matter of fact, narcotic cough syrups are the strongest narcotic available by prescription (percentage wise) because they don't mix it with tylonol to prevent overdose. Even still there is nothing that is one hundred percent effective in preventing a cough. Hot toddies are also good for sore throats of other forms of mild pain. It is pretty imporatant to get the dosing right in a child and it is illegal in many states.

No alcohol here and my parents were European. They did drink occasionally and my father used to have one beer every night after coming home but they didn't give us any. We had Robitussin for coughs and Mercurochrome for cuts. MY dh is always saying we need to get some Mercurochrome but we use polysporin instead.

Didn't read the other posts, and I don't know if this counts as medicating or not, but, my bio-father would give my 2 little brothers and me rum and coke to knock us out at night so he could drink himself on the weekends he had us. Sad, but, true and it did work. I think I was 5 so that would make my brothers 3 and 1. When I think about that, it makes me sick.
My grandma would rub a little whiskey on our gums when we were teething--not a lot just a little rub to the area the tooth was coming in on. From what I hear, that worked great.

## <a name=architecture-psychology</a>

Let us take two people.

Person 1's route to work consists of lush gardens. The office brickwork represents the century's cultural thought. Windows, purposefully, designed for maximum light. Even the gargoyles look pretty.

Person 2's route to work is through a sovietesque concrete jungle, there are no gardens, save for the weeds and lichens growing in pavement cracks. The only gargoyles are the gorilla-faced security guards that grunt at him as he shimmys through the revolving doors. He is greeted by a massive canvas of abstraction, by some up and coming artist, who he can't make heads or tails of what it represents and the brickwork is old and industrial.

The smoke alarm.. it's like chinese water torture

<img src=/pix/smoke-alarm-battery1.avif>

My new bride girdled to the red string of fate

Woe betide he who points out the chirp,
Woe befall on that little twirp,
Woe befall on the lie and disguise,
Wise words deludes the skies inside,
Woe belies on the comfort they nurse,
Woe betwixt such nights I can't catch a peep,
Where danger hides close, but shun he who speak,
Woe behest the silence they keep!
For the beeping grows louder, yet words remain weak
Woe beseech they who slumber in peace,
Woe beget fate which they will ignore,
The sound of the chirp which warns from the core,
For the lie whispers calm, while the flames seek the door,
And woe shall awaken too late to implore

I made a video on such [ceiling birds](https://youtube.com/shorts/bKbdi1G5Oh0?si=6o8axtzzPvCXRltj)

Crappy poems aside, smoke detector beeping is a real issue.

The cycle of rebirth


todo This was a meme back in the 90's and early 00's, too. Especially on Loveline, the radio show where teens and young people called in to discuss relationship problems. The callers often had smoke detectors with low batteries periodically going off in the background. It was so common, Loveline had a reoccurring bit where one of the hosts would make the caller shut up so they could time the beeps and predict them. The host would often joke that a lizard in a cage would try to kill itself if it was subjected to the beeping, but their callers somehow managed to ignore it.

## <a name=coffee-naming>Coffee Naming Convention</a>

<img src="/pix/no-nonsense-coffee-guide.avif" style="width: 250px;">

I remember in my naive adolesence, I had decided to enter a coffee sshop for the first time and ask for a black coffee and the man behind the counter kept asking if I wanted an americano. Never had I felt so shocked, it was as if I had strutted their butt-naked apart from a tie, only to be revealed at the counter that the English I had learned for the past 18 years was no good here. Imagine the first ever person to be told his cold-hard cash is no good and it's a contactless store

After some internet sleuthing it seems that the term Americano originates from American G.Is stationed at Italy in WW2, whereby they'd dilute espresso with hot water

After some even more internet sleuthing it turns out [all americano is black coffee but not all black coffe is americano](https://qavashop.com/en/academy/Post/the-difference-between-americano-and-black-coffee), at this point I'm just gonna hang up my hat - I'm not a coffee connoisseur

## <a name=contraception>Contraception</a>

Paraphrased from Fr. Josiah Trenham

God fashioned sexuality, the pleasure is so intense in order to justify the great burden of parenting

If you looked at a farmer and he took seed and he purposely threw it into the trees instead of the fields you'd think hes insane.

The fertile field is the maternal womb and can be an eternal being

Contraceptive sex is basically mutual masturbation, and it's like two dogs being in heat

Launched in a bid to boost local trade, the Exeter pound was only accepted by a number of local shops - designed to work alongside and not replace sterling

Daniel Hillier, who is one of the directors, said: "Shoppers tend to go to big name brands and we want to try to educate them to shop at the small, independent businesses.

"Certain businesses will be offering deals, like 5 or 10 percent off if you use the currency."

## <a name=fashionista-crime>Fashionista Crime</a>

Fashionista's do a lot of harm to the planet.

They do not understand 'timelessness', they try to revive a period of clothing they have no connection to, resurecting it and increasing the amount of clothes already in circulation, which will now be seen as outdated.

A lot of them who haven't studies classical tailoring proportions make clothes that don't fit well

Priceless or Worthless,

Lifeless or...

NOTE: Fashionista's far and large today are not continuing a long tradition of tailoring, they are incorporating wild and wacky ideas

<img src="/pix/theatre-garb.avif" style="width:350px;">

Fashionistas will take something beautiful like this, forgetting the precise rules regarding armholes, length, etc, distort it, waste scarce resources and continue with themselves

## <a name=great-font-shift>Great Font Shift</a>

I am not a font historian or connoisseur.

## <a name=kimono-washing>Kimono Washing</a>

Briefly put

For your precious painted kimono&hellip;

- Rip the lining

- Unsew all seams.

- Beat clothes in river to get sickness demon out

## How the pros do it

All images and captions are from [darumaya-gofuku.jp](//darumaya-gofuku.jp/maintenance/araihari)

This process is known as Arai Hari, 洗い張り,

_Stiching a kimono back into a tanmono, cleaning it drying it, cutting it and stictching it again..._

<img src="/pix/araihari1.avif" style="width:310px;">

Before washing and starching kimonos, we check to see if the color will bleed and if the fabric is durable

<img src="/pix/araihari2.avif" style="width:310px;">

All of the stitching on the kimono is removed

This is a time-consuming task as every last stitch must be removed

<img src="/pix/araihari3.avif" style="width:310px;">

The unraveled kimono is sewn back together into a roll of fabric
At our shop, we use a special sewing machine to sew the edges

<img src="/pix/araihari4.avif" style="width:310px;">

After the edges are sewn and the kimono is returned to its original shape, it is washed with a special detergent and a scrubbing brush

The temperature of the water and the amount of pressure used are adjusted depending on the kimono to remove dirt

<img src="/pix/araihari5.avif" style="width:310px;">

The washed cloth is dehydrated and hung outside to dry

<img src="/pix/araihari6.avif" style="width:310px;">

The washed rolls of fabric are re-sewn to fit the width of the work area
At this time, any frayed edges are re-sewn

<img src="/pix/araihari7.avif" style="width:310px;">

Shinko-bari

For rolls of tsumugi fabric, bamboo sticks with needles on the ends are stretched over the fabric, and wrinkles are smoothed out using the flexibility of the bamboo

As the sticks are stretched at 2cm intervals, approximately 600 sticks are used on one roll of fabric 

<img src="/pix/araihari8.avif" style="width:310px;">

A natural paste is applied to the stretched cloth with a brush
The thickness of the paste is adjusted according to the quality of the fabric and the season, so this requires years of experience

<img src="/pix/araihari9.avif" style="width:310px;">

Dry the roll of fabric with the starch applied
As it dries slowly with the fabric stretched, any wrinkles will disappear

<img src="/pix/araihari10.avif" style="width:310px;">

For crepe cloth, the width of the fabric is adjusted by applying steam using a machine called a tenter

<img src="/pix/araihari11.avif" style="width:310px;">

The finished cloth is rolled up on a board, laid flat, and bound with thread before being washed and hung

## <a name=lao-tzu>Lao Tzu</a>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 80

"A small country has fewer people.

Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.

The people take death seriously and do not travel far.

Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.

Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.

Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.

Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;

They are happy in their ways.

Though they live within sight of their neighbors,

And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,

Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die."

## <a name=mosquito-kill-squad>Mosquito Kill Squad</a>

When I visited Bangladesh, mosquito galore!

## How to prevent mosquito problem?

Kill at larval stage...

- drain/fill breeding site
- screening/covering water tanks
- dry out irrigation channel weekly, thus interrupting life-cycle of mosquito
- stock water sites with fish, which eat larvae, said fish can also be food source e.g. 'grass carp'

Without directly seeking mosqsuitios to execute you can do all of the above, now take that and extrapolate it to some other facets of life...

## <a name=phone-snatching>Phone Snatching</a>

Eastern Orthodox tradition goes that Lazarus, who was resurrected by Christ, never smiled during the thirty years following his resurrection, worried by the sight of unredeemed souls he witnessed during his four-day tenure in Hell. Yet when he sy someone stealing a pot, he smilingly said: "Clay steals clay".


I had the privilege to see the aftermath of not 1 but 2 phone-snatchings in the Olympic Park, East London.

The first time round, I was filld with immense rage towards the criminal even though I was neither the victim nor did I know him.

The second time around I felt completely apathetic. Why would I feel any anger? Someone stealing a tiny computer?

Will you see this as my patronage for villainy or see how phones are manmade and not worth getting angry about..

Can you live a diet purely of rabbit meat?

<img src="/pix/rabbit-starvation1.avif" style="width:210px; height: auto;">

Photo by -Bart Everson-

From the [Jungle, Desert, and Arctic Emergencies Booklet 1941]

"Because of the importance of fats, under no conditions limit yourself to a meat diet of rabbit just because they happen to be plentiful in the region where you are forced down. A continued diet of rabbit will produce rabbit starvation -- diarrhea will begin in about a week and if the diet is continued DEATH MAY RESULT."

They had no wine, no salt, no vinegar, no oil, but lived on wheat and barley, and the flesh of deer and *rabbits* boiled without salt, which caused dysentery, from which many died. 

## <a name=righteous-indignation>Righteous Indignation</a>

Righteous anger moves you in the right direction, the most egrigious thing one can do to themselves in having been inconvienced by something, perhaps even left at their wits end, is to not cut oneself from said thing, when easily available...

This isn't taught to children... Instead we are encouraged to do breathing exercises, meditate.. block out all noise. It doesn't help that in a classroom setting you cannot really remove yourlef from the problem

Such methods simply adapt our body to stress, instead of channelling that righteous anger to deal with said issue.

Of course living in a manmade society makes this a little difficult

Consider, the idiotic uproar over Lil Nas X. If you really took upbridge you'd uproot all the provocative music. Instead they roamed free on our airwaves. You should have been feeling righteous indignation years ago, or perhaps you didn't act on it

Thus the same offense, was blocked out, like white noise, until something touches your nerve.. but btw that new anger isn't righteous indignation it's childish anger

so many windows or mac os users, could have used that anger to switch to linux, when the time was right..

Zelensky gave this to Pope Francis but why?

In fact, this is not an icon, but a painting by Ukrainian artist Oleksiy Reveka. The image is titled “The Loss of 2022-58”. The author on his Facebook page claims that “this is a work about the loss of Ukrainian children in the aggressive war that Russia unleashed against Ukraine.”

I broke a x61s motherboard today. Let's frame everything I did wrong in a constructive manner so you can learn from my idiocy. I'll start by recreating the crime scene.

## Crime scene

<img src=/pix/x61s-5.avif style="width: 200px;">

What am I looking at you ask? Well to put it short, that black wire you see crawling on the screen? That's connected to the power jack in the bottom right corner and, which I didn't bother checking at the time. I hooked it up to the speaker port in the top left corner. What was the outcome of that. My friend and I got a very nice light show (sparks on the board and some transistors got fried).

Here's a close up.

## Why I did that

Do you see that red and black cable tucked away next to the RAM? Yep, that's the speaker plug, it's been donkeys-years since I hid it there. I didn't want it bumping around and I wasn't using the speaker at the time so it seemed the most convenient place.

Here's what it's supposed to look like on another board I owned.

And that black wire? It's meant to hook up to a bluetooth card.

Funny thing is just before all this unfolded. My friend called my McGyve style SSD removal genius. Here's a tip to removing a SSD if you don't have a caddy the with pull tab, get some tape and jimmy it up there, double sided on some thin plastic works. Or if you're tape is really-really strong you can just tap it on the SSD and pull.

Well, you shouldn't throw genius around liberally, I had 2 spare x61s motherboards with me and I could have done a quick web search to see what that black cable even was.

Anyways lesson learned. I hope I've framed my blunder in a constructive manner. Don't operate on guesswork, only toddlers plug random things in.

And I'll probably only mention in hushed tones now that I used to repair ThinkPadsfor a lving during 2020-2022

Anyways its got a compromised bios
