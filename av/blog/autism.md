Being on the 'verge, brink, edge' are scenarios you'd be hardpressed to find a low functioning  Autist in.

Autistic people, like every animal, are sensitive to stimuli, If they are exposed to too much stimuli they will try to exit the stressful environment or if  detained will thrash.

That is very normal.

Domesticated humans are 'adapted' in the sense that they can tolerate and aclimatize to stressful environments.

Lack of stimuli will also provoke an autistic person. They will exit a boring classroom.

It is viewed 'normal' for an autist to seek the path of least resistance because they are 'special' but if an ordinary person was to do the same they would face a lot of criticism.

Due to how society is structured, it is and cannot be Edenic, humans had to apopt non-autistic traits.

Autism is the default state of mankind. Autistic people are closer to bearing the same scent animals smelled upon Adam in the Garden.
