# City love

2024/10/21

## Can you actually ''love'' a city?

If  your soil becomes infertile and your rivers start to dry, your way of life goes belly-under.

Whereas in an urban environment, as long as you are geographically close to your work/school and economically 'safe' - you are more or less fine.

If your city is full of betting shops on every corner and societal ills creep into everyones way of life, as long as the above two criterion are met - again you are 'fine'.

Your stake in the city isn't tied down to the environment, ever see a most polluted cities list?
