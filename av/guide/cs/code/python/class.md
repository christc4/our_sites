A class is a boxed set of functions and variables. It defines a blueprint, of what variable and functions is together as a single thing.

## Define a Class

<object data="src/define_a_class.txt" width="512px" height="160px"></object>

By convention, class names start with a capital

## Instantiate a Class, Create a Object

Classes are just blueprints of structures. Classes are usesell by themselves, just as how functions are useless if you don't call them

So you need to create a instance of the class to acutally do something.

Instance of a Class is called Object

Define constructor

You can deefine a method in a class such that it'll be automatically called when the class is instantiated. Such a method is called constructoro (aka initializer)
