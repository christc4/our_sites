By focusing solely on 'survivors' or 'success stories' while overlooking those that didn't make it.

This bias leads to skewed conclusion and misguided decision-making, as it fails to accountnn for the hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface.

### <a name=halo>Halo</a>

The halo effect (sometimes called the halo error) is the proclivity for positive impressions of a person, company, country, brand, or product in one area to positively influence one's opinion or feelings.[1][2] Halo effect is "the name given to the phenomenon whereby evaluators tend to be influenced by their previous judgments of performance or personality."[3] The halo effect is a cognitive bias which can prevent someone from forming an image of a person, a product or a brand based on the sum of all objective circumstances at hand.

The term was coined by Edward Thorndike. A simplified example of the halo effect is a person, after noticing that an individual in a photograph is attractive, well groomed, and properly attired, then assuming, using a mental heuristic, that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of their own social concept.[4][5][6] This constant error in judgment is reflective of the individual's preferences, prejudices, ideology, aspirations, and social perception.[7][6][8][9][10]

Theorized, the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things, technology or ideas are proportional to their current age. The longer a period something has survived to exst or be used in the present, the longer its remaining life expectancy

### <a name=streisand>Streisand</a>

Try to hide, or otherwise draw attention away from something - only serves to attract more attention to it.

Name comes from singer/actress Barba Streisand's lawsuit against a photographer in 2003.

Kenneth Adelman (photographer), shot Californian coastline, posting the photos online, as free nonprofit images. Amongst 12,000 photos, one was Streisand's mansion. 

At the time, lawsuit was filed it'd only been downloaded six times, including twice by her own lawyers, after publicization of the lawsuit and a flurry of interest - the photo was viewed more than 400,000 times.


## <a name=fallacies>Fallacies</a>

### <a name=appeal-to-authority>Appeal to Authority</a>

A proposition isn't made true or false on the basis of whether an authority agrees with it; propositions have an independent truth value which an authority may err in identifiyng. 

Sands of scholarship shift greatly.

A model of movement in human-computer interaction and interaction.

In brief, it predicts the time required to quickly move to a target area is the function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.

In MacOS, if your active window is near the bottom of the screen, having the menu bar at the top edge is an extremely long trek. Except, this trek is to do an extremely simple computational task.

Also consider the return journey you have to make from menu bar to active window!

### <a name=ship-of-theseus>Ship of Theseus</a>

 
The Ship of Theseus was a famous vessel 

> The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrus Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question as to things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending it was not the same. 

> (Plutarch 1880, 7-8) 

In his De Corpore, Thomas Hobbes followed up an ancient suggestion that the ship's original planks might have been hoarded by a collector on land and reassembled, once every part had been replaced. Hobbes offered the reassembled ship as the true original. But he may have had his tongue in his cheek about the ambiguous use of language in truth claims. It is the true original, qua material, but not qua a functioning ship. 

In our case of the Ship of Theseus, we actually create two ships over time. We can look at this as creating two sets of coinciding objects. In each case, we focus on the persistent aspect and ignore the changes.

One persists as a functioning ship, ignoring the changes in matter (the planks). The other persists over time with respect to its matter. They both can claim to have preserved their identity over time with the original ship, but in different respects, the first qua functioning ship, the second qua material.

But what if both ships are seaworthy?
