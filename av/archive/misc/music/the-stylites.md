Your great great grandfather cleared a little piece of land

Your great grandfather helped to plow the field by hand

And your grandfather took it, made it grow and made it thrive

Then your father sold it off and took a steady nine-to-five
 
As for you, young man, in the city all alone

In a one-bedroom loft winter chills you to the bone

When you dream at night you feel the shovel in your hand

as you walk the fields of that little piece of land

well now Your great great grandmum She had fourteen kids to raise

and then Your great grandmum nearly followed in her ways 

Then your grandmother had three and decided to prevent

And your mom had just the one and she was an accident 

As for you, little girl, a different partner every night

And if anything goes wrong, you go to town and put it right

But in the silent morning you can almost hear the sound

Of a big kitchen table all the children gathered round

Your great grandfather's dad Was a depression-era man 

And your grandfather's dad Counted pennies in the hand 

And thank God, your granddad became a millionaire

Then your dad retired early to live off of his share 

As for you, young man, you owe your soul to uncle sam 

You can't even get a loan, and nobody gives a damn 

And so fight the temptation to commit armed robbery

you read those books about how to embrace simplicity

Your great great grandmom and dad They knew how to throw it down

Then your great grandmom and dad went a-swinging through this town 
And your grandmom and dad They sang twist and shout all night 

Your mom and dad met at a disco and it was love at first sight

As for you, my friend,  how do your evenings go?

Can you break away from the television glow

Some things never change under any circumstance 

Put your new shoes on kid cos we're going out to dance!

Hello folks good morning,

This is your captain speaking

We've got a fuel tank warning,

It's pretty badly leaking

Right out the guts of this metal bird,

Into the blue pacific,

We might have 15 minutes left,

If I were to be specific,

It'd bring a tear to a tatar's eye, 

Teach the weeping willow how to cry,

The golden years of your life go by,

Oh me oh my,

Right out  of the clear blue sky

Hello folks its me again,

Wishing I had some good news

But that's just life some days you win,

And other days you lose,

The ocean glitters in the sun,

It's been an honor to serve you,

God's children each and every one,

I surely don't deserve you,

You know you really couldn't pick,

A nicer day to die,

And I hope you choose pacific air,

The next time you fly,

It'd bring a tear to a tater's eye,

And teach the weeping willow how to cry,

The golden years of your life go by,

Oh me oh my,

Right out of the clear blue sky.

This sounds to me like someone bleeding out, their life slipping out of their grip
