## Should you buy an old ThinkPad?

- Is your computer usage processor intensive?
	- Video rendering, compilation, Triple A gaming?
	- go away

- Do you only edit documents, read emails and watch YouTube?
	- Then probably

- Are you worried about your laptop being stolen?
	- If yes, and you answered no to the first question. Then probably.

- Do you know what you are doing?
	- Then buy.

- Do you know or care about coreboot/libreboot?
	- If no to both, don't buy.

But I can have two machines! I can have my main rig kitted out for all the heavy lifting! And I can have a ThinkPad be my rugged retainer!

Go away.

### Even shorter answer

Unless you are a tinker willing to part with his time, don't bother.
I'd recommend keeping your eyes peeled on devices like the Framework laptop

## Back to wordy blog&hellip;

ThinkPads&hellip; the classic fixer-upper that you'll shell hundreds of dollars into - to get it even comparable to a modern machine. Or is it?

Let's find out!

As someone whose primary work, for a year, was reparing and reselling ThinkPads - I sort of have a position. Mind you, I'm out of the loop when it comes to current market prices but I can give my 2 cents. As per the title, this is going to tackle the subject of _old_ ThinkPads, what qualifies as _old_ - I'll say anything pre x240 era.

Say you're in the market for a *used* ThinkPad, we're gonna need to establish a long list of things.

1. Are you willing to learn new things?
    - Are you the person who is grossed out by the nipple? Unwilling, to learn a lighter operating system like Linux or BSD? Expecting. Learn to repair and swap parts?
    - If you're in the camp that says _X is only cheap, if your time is valueless_ then ThinkPads are not for you.

2. Are you prepared to deal with issues sourcing batteries?
    - Genuine OEM batteries are rarer by the day, as soon as you see one listed - snag it asap - as long as the price is reasonable.

# Buying experience

If you aren't buying direct from an enthusiast, you'll most likely be temporarily lumbered with someone's clunky old machine - shelved for eternity - if you hadn't bid on it. ThinkPads can be cheap as chips depending how you go about this.

Keycaps may be mirror-y,

Thought experiment
If a thinkpad is replaced part by part is it still the same ThinkPad?

ThinkPad on its last legs?
So what happens eventually when software becomes too bloated you can't run it? Home server?

ThinkPads are good for what they are.

If you plan on staying with it, you'll see how good she can treat you
